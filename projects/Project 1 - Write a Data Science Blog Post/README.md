This is a document to be used as a template for READMEs.
I will practice writing **bold** text, as well as _italics_, and I could also write some `code def fun():`.

## Installations
Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, as well as what version of python you are using should be noted.

## Project Motivation
Discuss what your project is about, and what interested you in pursuing the project.

## File Descriptions
Guide others through the files in your repository. You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find the work they might find most interesting.
