# Analysis of data scientist jobs on a job search engine during 2020.

## Introduction & Business Understanding
According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, data scientist job positions will increase about 30.9% by 2029 [¹](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/fastest-growing-occupations.htm). Another survey conducted by _Analytics Insight_, there will be 3,037,809 new job openings in data science in the world by 2021.[²](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/analytics-insight-predicts-3-million-job-openings-in-data-science-in-2021/)
Since the interest in data science is inscreasing, this project will help people that want to get into the data science field. Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the present project aimed to answer the folowing questions:

1.   Which companies have the most number of data scientist positions?
2.   What's the most frequent salary estimate?
3.   Which cities offer more job opportunities?

The results are also published on this [Medium post](https://xscbsx.medium.com/whats-the-current-scenario-of-data-scientist-job-opportunities-5dd31e1f59c8)

## Data Understanding
The  data used in this project was provided by the user [pickesueat](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data), who collected data from the website [Glassdoor](wwww.glassdoor.com) using webscrapping techniques. I refined some categories (column _Industry_) from the original file using Talend, so I could visualize the results in a better way.
